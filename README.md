If React makes you sad and you are learning it by copying from the boilerplate projects, read <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto" target="_blank">Pete Hunt's react-howto guide</a>.

If you are using a Flux library (or Redux) and it adds a lot of boilerplate for no obvious gain, read <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank">Thinking in React</a> article.

If you are just learning React and you are using a JavaScript bundler and you are not working on a production app, copy <a href="https://github.com/jarsbe/react-simple" target="_blank">jarsbe/react-simple</a> and start hacking with no build step.

If you don't feel confortable using ES2015 features (e.g. classes and fat arrows) and you feel like updating your JavaScript knowledge, <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read" target="_blank">Understanding ECMAScript 6</a> is an amazing guide. Use <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/" target="_blank">Babel</a> to verify your assumptions.
